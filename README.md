**1.   Data**

The data used to generate experimental results can be downloaded from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/194BtxOw4eEJscoFbmXsGbSugJ95MzJEJ), and then the files in the data_files folder can be placed in the data_files folder of this repository, and the files in the ngrams_res folder can be placed in the ngrams_res folder of this repository.
